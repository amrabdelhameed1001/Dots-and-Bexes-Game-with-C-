# Dots-and-Bexes-Game-with-C-
Dots and Boxes is a game for two players (the other player can be the computer in our app). Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box (or groups of one or more adjacent boxes) earns one point (s) and takes another turn. Finally, the player who earns mot points is the winner.
